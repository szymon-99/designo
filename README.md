# Static landing page built with Gatbsy

### This is my first website ever created.

[LIVE DEMO HERE](https://designo-ess.netlify.app/)

This site is with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) to manage data.

Desing comes from [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) but all of the code and functionallity was created by me. 

Technologies that i used in this project:
- styled components
- formik
- yup
- leaflet
- typescript
- gatsbyjs

This is project is not finished yet and i will definately need to work on the code since this was my first work.
